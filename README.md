# rock-paper-scissors

The third assignment project from The Odin Project. It is a simple rock-paper-scissor game. The result is displayed in the console, and this project is implemented using HTML, JavaScript.

This is the first version of this project. I will edit it later so that you can see the results on the user interface.
